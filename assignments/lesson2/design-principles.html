                <p>The brain disassociates objects from one another based upon the differences between their physical characteristics.</p>
                <p> These characteristics fall into four categories: color, size, alignment, and character.</p>
                <p> For each color in the image is for me what I saw first, second, and last. The red is what I saw first because of the images that was circulatiing. The green was second were items that I viewed previously. And the dark green was last .</p>

                    <p>The rule of thirds in web design: Know your layout sweet spots</p>
                    <p>Is the Rule of Thirds? The Rule of Thirds is another way to look at the layout of a design (be it a web page, a painting or a photograph). The idea is straightforward; you place a simple grid overlay (divided equally into thirds, both horizontally and vertically) on the space to be used for the design.</p>

                <p>When it comes to a website and I am given so many aoptions in this case books. I love this site so much because they have filters so that I can pick and choose what I am looking for.  </p>
                <p>I went into my phone and it was so easy to select what I was looking for. I know everyone can agree that having filters on websites make life that much sweeter</p>
